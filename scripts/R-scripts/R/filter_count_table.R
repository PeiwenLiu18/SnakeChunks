#' @title Filter features of an RNA-seq count table based on a combination of user-selected criteria. 
#' @author Jacques van Helden
#' @description Filter out the features of an RNA-seq count table based on several filters. 
#'
#' @param counts  A data frame with counts (one row per feature and one column per sample).
#' @param condition=NULL An optional vector indicating the  groups (condition, genotype, treatment) of each sample. Must have the same length as the number of columns of the count table. 
#' @param na.rm=FALSE Remove rows with at least one NA value.
#' @param mean.count=NULL Filter out the features having a cross-sample mean count lower than the specified value
#' @param min.count=NULL Filter out features for which the  max count (across all samples) is lower than the specified threshold.
#' @param mean.per.condition=NULL  ## Filter out features for which none of the conditions has a mean count above the threshold
#' @param black.list=NULL Black-listed" features: a vector of row IDs or row indices indicating a list of features to be filtered out (e.g. 16S, 12S RNA).
#' @return a data.frame with the same columns (samples) as the input count table, and with rows restricted to the features that pass all the thresholds.
