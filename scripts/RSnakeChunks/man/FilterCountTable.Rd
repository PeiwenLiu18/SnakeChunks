\title{Filter features of an RNA-seq count table based on a combination of user-selected criteria.}
\usage{
FilterCountTable(counts, condition = NULL, na.omit = FALSE,
  mean.count = NULL, min.count = NULL, mean.per.condition = NULL,
  black.list = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A data frame with counts (one row per feature and one column per sample).}

\item{condition=NULL}{An optional vector indicating the  groups (condition, genotype, treatment) of each sample. Must have the same length as the number of columns of the count table.}

\item{na.rm=FALSE}{Remove rows with at least one NA value.}

\item{mean.count=NULL}{Filter out the features having a cross-sample mean count lower than the specified value}

\item{min.count=NULL}{Filter out features for which the  max count (across all samples) is lower than the specified threshold.}

\item{mean.per.condition=NULL}{## Filter out features for which none of the conditions has a mean count above the threshold}

\item{black.list=NULL}{Black-listed" features: a vector of row IDs or row indices indicating a list of features to be filtered out (e.g. 16S, 12S RNA).}
}
\value{
a data.frame with the same columns (samples) as the input count table, and with rows restricted to the features that pass all the thresholds.
}
