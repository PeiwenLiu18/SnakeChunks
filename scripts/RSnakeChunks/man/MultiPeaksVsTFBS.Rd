\title{Compare several sets of genomic regions (e.g. Chip_seq peaks) with a set of reference genomic sites (e.g. transcription factor binding sites).}
\usage{
MultiPeaksVsTFBS(peakFiles, TFBSFile, PNGFile, main = "Mutual coverage plot",
  peakSetLabels = NULL, verbose = FALSE, drawPlots = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{peakFiles}{a vector contianing a list of files. Each file is supposed to contain a set of genomic regions, in bed format.}

\item{peakSetLabels}{a vector of the same size as peakFiles indicating a label for each peak set.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters are passed to plot()}

\item{sites}{path to a bed-formatted file containing the reference TFBSs. Passed to}

\item{main="Mutual}{coverage plot" main title for the plot.}

\item{verbose=FALSE}{if true, print messages during the execution}

\item{drawPlots=FALSE}{if true, draw diagnostic plots}
}
\value{
A table with one row per peak set, and one column per evaluation parameter (those reported by PeaksVsTFBS).
}
\description{
Evaluate and compare the accuracy of several peaksets by comparing each of 
them with a set of reference TFBSs. The comparison betwee a peak set and the TFBSs is done 
with PeaksVsSTBS, and this function recollects the results and presents them in a synthetic way.
