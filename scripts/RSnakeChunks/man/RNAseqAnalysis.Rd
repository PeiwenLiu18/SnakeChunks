\title{Normalisation and differential analysis of an RNA-seq count table}
\usage{
RNAseqAnalysis(countFile, configFile, checkSampleIDs = TRUE,
  main.dir = getwd(), result.dir = "results", verbose = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{countFile}{file containing a table with counts of reads per feature (row) in each sample (column).}

\item{configFile}{a yaml-formatted file defining the mandatory + some optional parameteres}

\item{main.dir=getwd()}{directory from which the script runs. Paths are defined relative to this directory.}

\item{result.dir="results"}{directory where the results will be stored. Should be defined relative to main directory.}

\item{norm.percentile=75}{default percentile to estimate sample-wise scaling factors. By default, set to the upper quartile. Will also be converted as p parameter (between 0 and 1) to tune edgeR upperquartile normalisation.}

\item{verbose=1}{level of verbosity}
}
\description{
Workflow for the analysis of differential expression with RNA-seq transcripttome data.
Includes
\itemize{
\item sample-wiste descriptive statistics (central tendency, dispersion, percentiles, ...)
\item between-sample normalisation with different options
\item detection of differentially expressed genes with DESeq2 and edgeR
\item comparisons between results obtained with alternative methods for between-sample normalisation
\item export of all results in tab-separated value files
\item export of figures in pdf and png formats
\item automatic generation of an HTML report (via Rmd) with links to result files and figures
