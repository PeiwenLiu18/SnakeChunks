rule md5sum:
    """Compute the md5sum signature for a given file, which enables to
    check the consistency of its content after transfer. 

    Note: md5sum is recommended for submitting NGS data to GEO.

    Usage: integrate in the targets of a workflow. 
    Alternatively, can be called directly on the command line with find.

    Example: find all the fastq files in a directory (named fastq) and
    compute one md5sum file for each, and assign the takss to 20 jobs
    in the scheduler.

    find fastq/ -name '*.fastq'  \
       | awk '{print $1".md5sum"}' \
       | xargs snakemake  -j 20 -p \
           -s gene-regulation/scripts/snakefiles/rules/md5sum.rules \
           --configfile metadata/Glossina_palpalis.yml

    Required parameters:
        config["qsub"]
