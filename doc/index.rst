Gene Regulation
================================================================

This git repository holds shared code for the analysis of Next
Generation Sequencing data related to gene regulation: ChIP-seq,
RNA-seq, and related technologies.

It was developed as part of the France Genomique Workpackage 2.6: 
Gene expression regulation. 

One of the key goals is to ensure portability and re-usability of the code.

We have chosen to use the `Snakemake workflow management
system <https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Home>`__\ [1] in
order to build reproducible and flexible NGS analysis pipelines.
