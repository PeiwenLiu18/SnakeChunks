# SnakeChunks

*Claire Rioualen - Jun. 29th, 2017*

This package was developed as part of the 
France Genomique  Workpackage 2.6 - Gene Regulation. 

It contains shared code for the analysis of Next
Generation Sequencing data related to gene regulation: ChIP-seq,
RNA-seq, and related technologies. 

Current version: 4.0.

We have chosen to use the [Snakemake workflow management system](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Home)[1] 
in order to build reproducible and flexible NGS analysis pipelines.

**A full documentation can be found on [Read The Docs](http://snakechunks.readthedocs.io).**
